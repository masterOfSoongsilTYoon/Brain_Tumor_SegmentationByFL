Federated Learning for Brain Tumor Segmentation
========

Step1: Centralized Brain Tumor Segmentation Training
--------

* mIOU By Each Models (Unet, MGUnet, DeeplabV3_Backbone)
![IOU](./Plot/mIOU_output.png) 

    Above graph show us model which have the highest mIOU in Brain tumor data is **U-net**


* Loss By Each Models (Unet, MGUnet, DeeplabV3_Backbone)

    Look likes, All model are similar loss decling
